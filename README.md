# üõë ATTENTION <br> Users from `flutter_local_notifications` plugin

`awesome_notifications` plugin is incompatible with `flutter_local_notifications`, as both plugins will compete each other to accquire global notification resources to send notifications and to receive notification actions.

So, you **MUST not use** `flutter_local_notifications` with `awesome_notifications`. Awesome Notifications contains all features available in `flutter_local_notifications` plugin and more, so you can replace totally `flutter_local_notifications` in your project.


<br>

# üõë ATTENTION <br> Users from `firebase_messaging` plugin
    
The support for `firebase_messaging` plugin is now deprecated, but all other firebase plugins are still being supported. And this happened by the same reason as `flutter_local_notifications`, as both plugins will compete each other to accquire global notification resources.

To use FCM services with Awesome Notifications, you need use the [Awesome Notifications FCM add-on plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications_fcm).

Only using [awesome_notifications_fcm](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications_fcm) you will be capable to achieve all Firebase Cloud Messaging features + all Awesome Notifications features. To keep using firebase_messaging, you gonna need to do workarounds with silent push notifications, and this is disrecommended to display visual notifications and will result in several background penalities to your application.
    
So, you **MUST not use** `firebase_messaging` with `awesome_notifications`. Use `awesome_notifications` with `awesome_notifications_fcm` instead.
    
<br>
<br>
    
# ‚úÖ Next steps

- Include Web support
- Finish the add-on plugin to enable Firebase Cloud Message with all the awesome features available. (accomplished)
- Add an option to choose if a notification action should bring the app to foreground or not. (accomplished)
- Include support for another push notification services (Wonderpush, One Signal, IBM, AWS, Azure, etc)
- Replicate all Android layouts for iOS (almost accomplished)
- Custom layouts for notifications

# üî∂ Main Philosophy

Considering all the many different devices available, with different hardware and software resources, this plugin ALWAYS shows the notification, trying to use all features available. If the feature is not available, the notification ignores that specific feature, but shows the rest of notification anyway.

**Example**: If the device has LED colored lights, use it. Otherwise, ignore the lights, but shows the notification with all another features available. In last case, shows at least the most basic notification.

Also, the Notification Channels follows the same rule. If there is no channel segregation of notifications, use the channel configuration as defaults configuration. If the device has channels, use it as expected to be.

And all notifications sent while the app was killed are registered and delivered as soon as possible to the Application, after the plugin initialization, respecting the delivery order.

This way, your Application will receive **all notifications events at Flutter level code**.
    
<br>
<br>

#  üöö Migrating from version 0.6.X to 0.7.X<br>Breaking changes

* Now it's possible to receive action events without bring the app to foreground. Check our action type's topic to know more.
* All streams (createdStream, displayedStream, actionStream and dismissedStream) was replaced by `global static methods`. You must replace your old stream methods by static and global methods, in other words, they must be `static Future<void>` and use `async`/`await` and you MUST use `@pragma("vm:entry-point")` to preserve dart addressing.
<br>(To use context and redirect the user to another page inside static methods, please use flutter navigatorKey or another third party library, such as GetX. Check our [How to show Local Notifications](#-how-to-show-local-notifications) topic to know more).
* Now all the notification events are delivered only after the first setListeners being called.
* The ButtonType class was renamed to ActionType.
* The action type `InputField` is deprecated. Now you just need to set the property `requireInputText` to true to achieve the same, but now it works combined with all another action types.
* The support for `firebase_messaging` plugin is now deprecated, but all other firebase plugins still being supported. You need use the [Awesome's FCM add-on plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications_fcm) to achieve all firebase messaging features, without violate the platform rules. This is the only way to fully integrated with awesome notifications, running all in native level.


<br>
<br>

# üõ† Getting Started

<br>

## Initial Configurations

Bellow are the obligatory configurations that your app must meet to use awesome_notifications:

<br>

### ü§ñ Configuring Android

1 - Is required the minimum android SDK to 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop) and Java compiled SDK Version to 33 (Android 13). You can change the `minSdkVersion` to 21 and the `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` to 33, inside the file `build.gradle`, located inside "android/app/" folder.
```Gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 33
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

Also, to turn your app fully compatible with Android 13 (SDK 33), you need to add the attribute `android:exported="true"` to any \<activity\>, \<activity-alias\>, \<service\>, or \<receiver\> components that have \<intent-filter\> declared inside in the app‚Äôs AndroidManifest.xml file, and that's turns required for every other flutter packages that you're using.

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapp">
   <application>
        ...
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            ...
            android:exported="true">
                ...
        </activity>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```
<br>
<br>

### üçé Configuring iOS

To use Awesome Notifications and build your app correctly, you need to ensure to set some `build settings` options for your app targets. In your project view, click on *Runner -> Target Runner -> Build settings*...  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40064496/194729267-6fbfc78c-8cba-422b-8af7-d7099f359adb.png)

... and set the following options:

In *Runner* Target:
* Build libraries for distribution => NO
* Only safe API extensions => NO
* iOS Deployment Target => 11 or greater

In *all other* Targets:
* Build libraries for distribution => NO
* Only safe API extensions => YES

<br>
<br>

# üì® How to show Local Notifications

<br>

1. Add *awesome_notifications* as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
awesome_notifications: any # Any attribute updates automatically your source to the last version
```

2. import the plugin package to your dart code

```dart
import 'package:awesome_notifications/awesome_notifications.dart';
```

3. Initialize the plugin on main.dart, before MaterialApp widget (preferentially inside main() method), with at least one native icon and one channel

```dart
AwesomeNotifications().initialize(
  // set the icon to null if you want to use the default app icon
  'resource://drawable/res_app_icon',
  [
    NotificationChannel(
        channelGroupKey: 'basic_channel_group',
        channelKey: 'basic_channel',
        channelName: 'Basic notifications',
        channelDescription: 'Notification channel for basic tests',
        defaultColor: Color(0xFF9D50DD),
        ledColor: Colors.white)
  ],
  // Channel groups are only visual and are not required
  channelGroups: [
    NotificationChannelGroup(
        channelGroupKey: 'basic_channel_group',
        channelGroupName: 'Basic group')
  ],
  debug: true
);
```

4. Inside the MaterialApp widget, create your named routes and set your global navigator key. Also, inside initState, initialize your static listeners methods to capture notification's actions.
OBS 1: With the navigator key, you can redirect pages and get context even inside static classes.
OBS 2: Only after setListeners being called, the notification events starts to be delivered.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {

  static final GlobalKey<NavigatorState> navigatorKey = GlobalKey<NavigatorState>();

  static const String name = 'Awesome Notifications - Example App';
  static const Color mainColor = Colors.deepPurple;

  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {

  @override
  void initState() {

    // Only after at least the action method is set, the notification events are delivered
    AwesomeNotifications().setListeners(
        onActionReceivedMethod:         NotificationController.onActionReceivedMethod,
        onNotificationCreatedMethod:    NotificationController.onNotificationCreatedMethod,
        onNotificationDisplayedMethod:  NotificationController.onNotificationDisplayedMethod,
        onDismissActionReceivedMethod:  NotificationController.onDismissActionReceivedMethod
    );

    super.initState();
  }

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(

      // The navigator key is necessary to allow to navigate through static methods
      navigatorKey: MyApp.navigatorKey,

      title: MyApp.name,
      color: MyApp.mainColor,

      initialRoute: '/',
      onGenerateRoute: (settings) {
        switch (settings.name) {
          case '/':
            return MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) =>
                MyHomePage(title: MyApp.name)
            );

          case '/notification-page':
            return MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) {
              final ReceivedAction receivedAction = settings
                  .arguments as ReceivedAction;
              return MyNotificationPage(receivedAction: receivedAction);
            });

          default:
            assert(false, 'Page ${settings.name} not found');
            return null;
        }
      },

      theme: ThemeData(
          primarySwatch: Colors.deepPurple
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

OBS: Note that the example below is not a valid static or global method. You can retrieve the current context from the NavigatorKey instance, declared on MaterialApp widget, at any time.
```Dart
    AwesomeNotifications().setListeners(
        onActionReceivedMethod: (ReceivedAction receivedAction){
            NotificationController.onActionReceivedMethod(context, receivedAction);
        },
        onNotificationCreatedMethod: (ReceivedNotification receivedNotification){
            NotificationController.onNotificationCreatedMethod(context, receivedNotification);
        },
        onNotificationDisplayedMethod: (ReceivedNotification receivedNotification){
            NotificationController.onNotificationDisplayedMethod(context, receivedNotification);
        },
        onDismissActionReceivedMethod: (ReceivedAction receivedAction){
            NotificationController.onDismissActionReceivedMethod(context, receivedAction);
        },
    );
```

5. Create in any place or class, the static methods to capture the respective notification events.
OBS: You need to use `@pragma("vm:entry-point")` in each static method to identify to the Flutter engine that the dart address will be called from native and should be preserved.

```dart
class NotificationController {

  /// Use this method to detect when a new notification or a schedule is created
  @pragma("vm:entry-point")
  static Future <void> onNotificationCreatedMethod(ReceivedNotification receivedNotification) async {
    // Your code goes here
  }

  /// Use this method to detect every time that a new notification is displayed
  @pragma("vm:entry-point")
  static Future <void> onNotificationDisplayedMethod(ReceivedNotification receivedNotification) async {
    // Your code goes here
  }

  /// Use this method to detect if the user dismissed a notification
  @pragma("vm:entry-point")
  static Future <void> onDismissActionReceivedMethod(ReceivedAction receivedAction) async {
    // Your code goes here
  }

  /// Use this method to detect when the user taps on a notification or action button
  @pragma("vm:entry-point")
  static Future <void> onActionReceivedMethod(ReceivedAction receivedAction) async {
    // Your code goes here

    // Navigate into pages, avoiding to open the notification details page over another details page already opened
    MyApp.navigatorKey.currentState?.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil('/notification-page',
            (route) => (route.settings.name != '/notification-page') || route.isFirst,
        arguments: receivedAction);
  }
}
```

6. Request the user authorization to send local and push notifications (Remember to show a dialog alert to the user before call this request)

```dart
AwesomeNotifications().isNotificationAllowed().then((isAllowed) {
  if (!isAllowed) {
    // This is just a basic example. For real apps, you must show some
    // friendly dialog box before call the request method.
    // This is very important to not harm the user experience
    AwesomeNotifications().requestPermissionToSendNotifications();
  }
});
```

7. In any place of your app, create a new notification

```dart
AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
  content: NotificationContent(
      id: 10,
      channelKey: 'basic_channel',
      title: 'Simple Notification',
      body: 'Simple body',
      actionType: ActionType.Default
  )
);
```
<br>

<br>
<br>

## üìù Important notes

<br>

1 . You must initialize all Awesome Notifications plugins, even if your app does not have permissions to send notifications.

2 . In case you need to capture the user notification action before calling the method `setListeners`, you can call the method `getInitialNotificationAction` at any moment.
In case your app was started by an user notification action, `getInitialNotificationAction` will return the respective `ActionReceived` object. Otherwise will return null.

OBS: `getInitialNotificationAction` method does not affect the results from `onActionReceivedMethod`, except if you set `removeFromActionEvents` to `true`.

```dart
void main() async {
    ReceivedAction? receivedAction = await AwesomeNotifications().getInitialNotificationAction(
      removeFromActionEvents: false
    );
    if(receivedAction?.channelKey == 'call_channel') setInitialPageToCallPage();
    else setInitialPageToHomePage();
}
```

3 . In case you need to redirect the user after a `silentAction` or `silentBackgroundAction` event, you may face the situation where you are running inside an dart Isolate with no valid Context to redirect the user.
For these cases, you need to use `ReceivePort` and `SendPort` to switch execution between the isolates. Just create a `ReceivePort` inside your initialization process (which only occurs in main isolated), and then, inside your `onActionReceivedMethod`, use `SendPort` to send the execution to the listening `ReceivePort`.


In the initialization of your notification_controller.dart:
```Dart
    ReceivePort port = ReceivePort();
    IsolateNameServer.registerPortWithName(
      port,
      'background_notification_action',
    );

    port.listen((var received) async {
        _handleBackgroundAction(received);
    });
    
    _initialized = true;
```

In your backgroundActionMethod:
```Dart
  static Future<void> onSilentActionHandle(ReceivedAction received) async {
    print('On new background action received: ${received.toMap()}');

    if (!_initialized) {
      SendPort? uiSendPort = IsolateNameServer.lookupPortByName('background_notification_action');
      if (uiSendPort != null) {
        print('Background action running on parallel isolate without valid context. Redirecting execution');
        uiSendPort.send(received);
        return;
      }
    }
    
    print('Background action running on main isolate');
    await _handleBackgroundAction(received);
  }

  static Future<void> _handleBackgroundAction(ReceivedAction received) async {
    // Your background action handle
  }
```

<br>

4. On Android, if you press the back button until leave the app and then reopen it using the "Recent apps list" *`THE LAST APP INITIALIZATION WILL BE REPEATED`*. So, if your app was started up by a notification, in this exclusive case the notification action will be repeated. As you know the business logic of your app, you need to decide if that notification action can be repeated or if it must be ignored.

<br>
<br>

# üçé‚Å∫ Extra iOS Setup for Background Actions

<br>

On iOS, to use any plugin inside background actions, you will need to manually register each plugin you want. Otherwise, you will face the `MissingPluginException` exception.
To avoid this, you need to add the following lines to the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method in your iOS project's AppDelegate.m/AppDelegate.swift file:

```Swift
import Flutter
import awesome_notifications
import shared_preferences_ios
//import all_other_plugins_that_i_need

override func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
  ) -> Bool {
      GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)

      // This function registers the desired plugins to be used within a notification background action
      SwiftAwesomeNotificationsPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback { registry in          
          SwiftAwesomeNotificationsPlugin.register(
            with: registry.registrar(forPlugin: "io.flutter.plugins.awesomenotifications.AwesomeNotificationsPlugin")!)          
          FLTSharedPreferencesPlugin.register(
            with: registry.registrar(forPlugin: "io.flutter.plugins.sharedpreferences.SharedPreferencesPlugin")!)
      }

      return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
  }
```

And you can check how to correctly call each plugin opening the file `GeneratedPluginRegistrant.m`

<br>
<br>

# üì± Example Apps

<br>

With the examples bellow, you can check all the features and how to use the Awesome Notifications in pratice. The Simple Example app contains the basic structure to use Awesome Notifications, and the Complete Example App contains all Awesome Notification features to test.

To run and debug the Simple Example App, follow the steps bellow:

1. Create a new Flutter project with at least Android and iOS
2. Copy the example content at https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications/example
3. Paste the content inside the `main.dart` file
4. Debug the application with a real device or emulator


To run and debug the Complete Example App, follow the steps bellow:

1. Install GitHub software in your local machine. I strongly recommend to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Go to one of our GitHub repositories
3. Clone the project to your local machine
4. Open the project with Android Studio or any other IDE
5. Sync the project dependencies running `flutter pub get`
6. On iOS, run `pod install` inside the folder *example/ios/* to sync the native dependencies
7. Debug the application with a real device or emulator

<br>
<br>
    
# üî∑ Awesome Notification's Flowchart

Notifications are received by local code or Push service using native code, so the messages will appears immediately or at schedule time, independent of your application is running or not.

![Awesome Notification's flowchart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40064496/197368144-7bfcee7e-644a-4bdc-80f1-b4d38c2eaaff.png)

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Notification Events

The notification events are only delivered after `setListeners` method being called, and they are not always delivered at same time as they happen.
The awesome notifications event methods available to track your notifications are:

* **onNotificationCreatedMethod (optional)**: Fires when a notification is created  
* **onNotificationDisplayedMethod (optional)**: Fires when a notification is displayed on system status bar  
* **onActionReceivedMethod (required)**: Fires when a notification is tapped by the user  
* **onDismissedActionReceivedMethod (optional)**: Fires when a notification is dismissed by the user (sometimes the OS denies the deliver)

... and these are the delivery conditions:

| Platform    | App in Foreground | App in Background | App Terminated (Killed) |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Android** | Fires all events immediately after occurs | Fires all events immediately after occurs | Store events to be fired when app is on Foreground or Background |
| **iOS**     | Fires all events immediately after occurs | Store events to be fired when app is on Foreground | Store events to be fired when app is on Foreground |


Exception: **onActionReceivedMethod** fires all events immediately after occurs in any application life cycle, for all Platforms.

<br>
<br>

# üëä Notification Action Types

The notification action type defines how awesome notifications should handle the user actions.
OBS: For silent types, its necessary to hold the execution with await keyword, to prevent the isolates to shutdown itself before all work is done.

 * Default: Is the default action type, forcing the app to goes foreground.
 * SilentAction: Do not forces the app to go foreground, but runs on main thread, accept visual elements and can be interrupt if main app gets terminated.
 * SilentBackgroundAction: Do not forces the app to go foreground and runs on background, not accepting any visual element. The execution is done on an exclusive dart isolate.
 * KeepOnTop: Fires the respective action without close the notification status bar and don't bring the app to foreground.
 * DisabledAction: When pressed, the notification just close itself on the tray, without fires any action event.
 * DismissAction: Behaves as the same way as a user dismissing action, but dismissing the respective notification and firing the onDismissActionReceivedMethod. Ignores autoDismissible property.
 * InputField: (Deprecated) When the button is pressed, it opens a dialog shortcut to send an text response. Use the property `requireInputText` instead.

<br>
<br>

# üü¶ Notification's Category

The notification category is a group of predefined categories that best describe the nature of the notification and may be used by some systems for ranking, delay or filter the notifications. Its highly recommended to correctly categorize your notifications.

 * Alarm: Alarm or timer.
 * Call: incoming call (voice or video) or similar synchronous communication request
 * Email: asynchronous bulk message (email).
 * Error: error in background operation or authentication status.
 * Event: calendar event.
 * LocalSharing: temporarily sharing location.
 * Message: incoming direct message (SMS, instant message, etc.).
 * MissedCall: incoming call (voice or video) or similar synchronous communication request
 * Navigation: map turn-by-turn navigation.
 * Progress: progress of a long-running background operation.
 * Promo: promotion or advertisement.
 * Recommendation: a specific, timely recommendation for a single thing. For example, a news app might want to recommend a news story it believes the user will want to read next.
 * Reminder: user-scheduled reminder.
 * Service: indication of running background service.
 * Social: social network or sharing update.
 * Status: ongoing information about device or contextual status.
 * StopWatch: running stopwatch.
 * Transport: media transport control for playback.
 * Workout: tracking a user's workout.

# üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Requesting Permissions

Permissions give transparency to the user of what you pretend to do with your app while its in use. To show any notification on device, you must obtain the user consent and keep in mind that this consent can be revoke at any time, in any platform. On Android, the basic permissions are always conceived to any new installed app, but for iOS, even the basic permission must be requested to the user.

The permissions can be defined in 3 types:

- Normal permissions: Are permissions not considered dangerous and do not require the explicit user consent to be enabled.
- Execution permissions: Are permissions considered more sensible to the user and you must obtain his explicit consent to use.
- Special/Dangerous permissions: Are permissions that can harm the user experience or his privacy and you must obtain his explicit consent and, depending of what platform are you running, you must obtain permission from the manufacture itself to use it.

As a good pratice, consider always to check if the permissions that you're desiring are conceived before create any new notification, independent of platform. To check if the permissions needs the explicity user consent, call the method shouldShowRationaleToRequest. The list of permissions that needs a rationale to the user can be different between platforms and O.S. versions. And if you app does not require extremely the permission to execute what you need, consider to not request the user permission and respect his will.

<br>
    
### Notification's Permissions:

- Alert: Alerts are notifications with high priority that pops up on the user screen. Notifications with normal priority only shows the icon on status bar.

- Sound: Sound allows the ability to play sounds for new displayed notifications. The notification sounds are limited to a few seconds and if you pretend to play a sound for more time, you must consider to play a background sound to do it simultaneously with the notification.

- Badge: Badge is the ability to display a badge alert over the app icon to alert the user about updates. The badges can be displayed on numbers or small dots, depending of platform or what the user defined in the device settings. Both Android and iOS can show numbers on badge, depending of its version and distribution.

- Light: The ability to display colorful small lights, blanking on the device while the screen is off to alert the user about updates. Only a few Android devices have this feature.

- Vibration: The ability to vibrate the device to alert the user about updates.

- FullScreenIntent: The ability to show the notifications on pop up even if the user is using another app.

- PreciseAlarms: Precise alarms allows the scheduled notifications to be displayed at the expected time. This permission can be revoke by special device modes, such as battery save mode, etc. Some manufactures can disable this feature if they decide that your app is consumpting many computational resources and decressing the baterry life (and without changing the permission status for your app). So, you must take in consideration that some schedules can be delayed or even not being displayed, depending of what platform are you running. You can increase the chances to display the notification at correct time, enable this permission and setting the correct notification category, but you never gonna have 100% sure about it.

- CriticalAlert: Critical alerts is a special permission that allows to play sounds and vibrate for new notifications displayed, even if the device is in Do Not Disturb / Silent mode. For iOS, you must request Apple a authorization to your app use it.

- OverrideDnD: Override DnD allows the notification to decrease the Do Not Disturb / Silent mode level enable to display critical alerts for Alarm and Call notifications. For Android, you must require the user consent to use it. For iOS, this permission is always enabled with CriticalAlert.

- Provisional: (Only has effect on iOS) The ability to display notifications temporarily without the user consent.

- Car: The ability to display notifications while the device is in car mode.

    
OBS: If none permission is requested through `requestPermissionToSendNotifications` method, the standard permissions requested are Alert, Badge, Sound, Vibrate and Light.

<br>
    
### Notification's Permission Level

A permission can be segregated in 3 different levels:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40064496/143137760-32b99fad-5827-4d0e-9d4f-c39c82ca6bfd.png)


- Device level: The permissions set at the global device configuration are applicable at any app installed on device, such as disable/enable all notifications, battery save mode / low power mode and silent / do not disturb mode.
- Application level: The permissions set at the global app configurations are applicable to any notification in any channel.
- Channel level: The permissions set on the channel has effect only for notifications displayed through that specific channel.

<br>
    
### Full example on how to request permissions

Below is a complete example of how to check if the desired permission is enabled and how to request it by showing a dialog with a rationale if necessary (this example is taken from our sample app):

```Dart
  static Future<List<NotificationPermission>> requestUserPermissions(
      BuildContext context,{
      // if you only intends to request the permissions until app level, set the channelKey value to null
      required String? channelKey,
      required List<NotificationPermission> permissionList}
    ) async {

    // Check if the basic permission was conceived by the user
    if(!await requestBasicPermissionToSendNotifications(context))
      return [];

    // Check which of the permissions you need are allowed at this time
    List<NotificationPermission> permissionsAllowed = await AwesomeNotifications().checkPermissionList(
        channelKey: channelKey,
        permissions: permissionList
    );

    // If all permissions are allowed, there is nothing to do
    if(permissionsAllowed.length == permissionList.length)
      return permissionsAllowed;

    // Refresh the permission list with only the disallowed permissions
    List<NotificationPermission> permissionsNeeded =
      permissionList.toSet().difference(permissionsAllowed.toSet()).toList();

    // Check if some of the permissions needed request user's intervention to be enabled
    List<NotificationPermission> lockedPermissions = await AwesomeNotifications().shouldShowRationaleToRequest(
        channelKey: channelKey,
        permissions: permissionsNeeded
    );

    // If there is no permissions depending on user's intervention, so request it directly
    if(lockedPermissions.isEmpty){

      // Request the permission through native resources.
      await AwesomeNotifications().requestPermissionToSendNotifications(
          channelKey: channelKey,
          permissions: permissionsNeeded
      );

      // After the user come back, check if the permissions has successfully enabled
      permissionsAllowed = await AwesomeNotifications().checkPermissionList(
          channelKey: channelKey,
          permissions: permissionsNeeded
      );
    }
    else {
      // If you need to show a rationale to educate the user to conceived the permission, show it
      await showDialog(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) => AlertDialog(

# üìÖ Scheduling a Notification

Schedules could be created from a UTC or local time zone, and specifying a time interval or setting a calendar filter. Notifications could be scheduled even remotely.
Attention: for iOS, is not possible to define the correct `displayedDate`, because is not possible to run exactly at same time with the notification schedules when it arrives in the user status bar.

To send notifications schedules, you need to instantiate one of the classes bellow in the notification property 'schedule':

- NotificationCalendar: Creates a notification scheduled to be displayed when the set date components matches the current date. If a time component is set to null, so any value is considered valid to produce the next valid date. Only one value is allowed by each component.
- NotificationInterval: Creates a notification scheduled to be displayed at each interval time, starting from the next valid interval.
- NotificationAndroidCrontab: Creates a notification scheduled to be displayed based on a list of precise dates or a crontab rule, with seconds precision. To know more about how to create a valid crontab rule, take a look at [this article](https://www.baeldung.com/cron-expressions).

Also, all of then could be configured using:

- timeZone: describe which time zone that schedule is based (valid examples: America/Sao_Paulo, America/Los_Angeles, GMT+01:00, Europe/London, UTC)
- allowWhileIdle: Determines if notification will send, even when the device is in critical situation, such as low battery.
- repeats: Determines if the schedule should be repeat after be displayed. If there is no more valid date compatible with the schedule rules, the notification is automatically canceled.

For time zones, please note that:

- Dates with UTC time zones are triggered at the same time in all parts of the planet and are not affected by daylight rules.
- Dates with local time zones, defined such "GMT-07: 00", are not affected by daylight rules.
- Dates with local time zones, defined such "Europe / Lisbon", are affected by daylight rules, especially when scheduled based on a calendar filter.

Here are some practical examples of how to create a notification scheduled:

```Dart
  String localTimeZone = await AwesomeNotifications().getLocalTimeZoneIdentifier();
  String utcTimeZone = await AwesomeNotifications().getLocalTimeZoneIdentifier();

  await AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
      content: NotificationContent(
          id: id,
          channelKey: 'scheduled',
          title: 'Notification at every single minute',
          body:
              'This notification was schedule to repeat at every single minute.',
          notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.BigPicture,
          bigPicture: 'asset://assets/images/melted-clock.png'),
      schedule: NotificationInterval(interval: 60, timeZone: localTimeZone, repeats: true));
```

```Dart
await AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
  content: NotificationContent(
      id: id,
      channelKey: 'scheduled',
      title: 'wait 5 seconds to show',
      body: 'now is 5 seconds later',
      wakeUpScreen: true,
      category: NotificationCategory.Alarm,
  ),
  schedule: NotificationInterval(
      interval: 5,
      timeZone: localTimeZone,
      preciseAlarm: true,
      timezone: await AwesomeNotifications().getLocalTimeZoneIdentifier()
  );
```

```Dart
  await AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
      content: NotificationContent(
          id: id,
          channelKey: 'scheduled',
          title: 'Notification at exactly every single minute',
          body: 'This notification was schedule to repeat at every single minute at clock.',
          notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.BigPicture,
          bigPicture: 'asset://assets/images/melted-clock.png'),
      schedule: NotificationCalendar(second: 0, timeZone: localTimeZone, repeats: true));
```

```Dart
 await AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
  content: NotificationContent(
    id: id,
    channelKey: 'scheduled',
    title: 'Just in time!',
    body: 'This notification was schedule to shows at ' +
        (Utils.DateUtils.parseDateToString(scheduleTime.toLocal()) ?? '?') +
        ' $timeZoneIdentifier (' +
        (Utils.DateUtils.parseDateToString(scheduleTime.toUtc()) ?? '?') +
        ' utc)',
    wakeUpScreen: true,
    category: NotificationCategory.Reminder,
    notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.BigPicture,
    bigPicture: 'asset://assets/images/delivery.jpeg',
    payload: {'uuid': 'uuid-test'},
    autoDismissible: false,
  ),
  schedule: NotificationCalendar.fromDate(date: scheduleTime));
```

## ‚è∞ Schedule Precision

It's important to keep in mind that some Android distributions could ignore or delay the schedule execution, if their algorithms judge it necessary to save the battery life, etc, and this intervention is even more common for repeating schedules. Im most cases this behavior is recommended, since as a battery-hungry app can denigrate the app and the manufacturer's image. Therefore, you need to consider this fact in your business logic.

But, for some cases where the schedules precision is a MUST requirement, you can use some features to ensure the execution in the correct time:

- Set the notification's category to a critical category, such as Alarm, Reminder or Call.
- Set the `preciseAlarm` property to true. For Android versions greater or equal than 12, you need to explicitly request the user consent to enable this feature. You can request the permission with `requestPermissionToSendNotifications` or take the user to the permission page calling `showAlarmPage`.
- Set `criticalAlerts` channel property and notification content property to true. This feature allows you to show notification and play sounds even when the device is on silent / Do not Disturb mode. Because of it, this feature is considered highly sensitive and you must request Apple a special authorization to use it. On Android, for versions greater or equal than 11, you need to explicitly request the user consent to enable this feature. You can request the permission with `requestPermissionToSendNotifications`.


To enable precise alarms, you need to add the `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` permission into your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, inside the `Android/app/src/main/` folder

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
   package="com.example">
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"/>
   <application>
       ...
   </application>
</manifest>
```

To enable critical alerts, you need to add the `ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY` permission into your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, inside the `Android/app/src/main/` folder

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
   package="com.example">
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY"/>
   <application>
       ...
   </application>
</manifest>
```

For iOS, you must submit a request authorization to Apple to enable it, as described [in this post](https://medium.com/@shashidharyamsani/implementing-ios-critical-alerts-7d82b4bb5026).


<br>

## üìù Important Notes:

1. Schedules may be severaly delayed or denied if the device/application is in battery saver mode or locked to perform background tasks. Teach your users with a good rationale to not set these modes and tell them the consequences of doing so. Some battery saving modes may differ between manufacturers, for example Samsung and Xiaomi (the last one sets the battery saving mode automatically for each new app installed).
2. If you're running your app in debug mode, right after close it all schedules may be erased by Android OS. Thats happen to ensure the same execution in debug mode for each debug startup. To make schedule tests on Android while terminated, remember to open your app without debug it.
3. If your app doesn't need to be as accurate to display schedule notifications, don't request for exact notifications. Be reasonable.
4. Remember to categorize your notifications correctly to avoid scheduling delays.
5. Critical alerts are still under development and should not be used in production mode.

<br>

## Old schedule Cron rules (For versions older than 0.0.6)

Due to the way that background task and notification schedules works on iOS, wasn't possible yet to enable officially all the old Cron features on iOS while the app is in Background and even when the app is terminated (Killed).
Thanks to this, the complex schedules based on cron tab rules are only available on Android by the class `NotificationAndroidCrontab`.

A support ticket was opened for Apple in order to resolve this issue, but they don't even care about. You can follow the progress of the process [here](https://github.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications/issues/16).

# ‚åõÔ∏è Progress Bar Notifications (Only for Android)

To show progress bar using local notifications, you need to create a notification with Layout `ProgressBar` and set a progress ammount between 0 and 100, or set it's progress as indeterminated.

To update your notificaiton progress you need to create a new notification with same id and you MUST not exceed 1 second between each update, otherwise your notifications will be randomly blocked by O.S.

Below is an example of how to update your progress notification:

```Dart
int currentStep = 0;
Timer? udpateNotificationAfter1Second;
Future<void> showProgressNotification(int id) async {
  int maxStep = 10;
  int fragmentation = 4;
  for (var simulatedStep = 1;
      simulatedStep <= maxStep * fragmentation + 1;
      simulatedStep++) {
    currentStep = simulatedStep;
    await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 1000 ~/ fragmentation));
    if(udpateNotificationAfter1Second != null) continue;
    udpateNotificationAfter1Second = Timer(
        const Duration(seconds: 1),
        (){
          _updateCurrentProgressBar(
            id: id,
            simulatedStep: currentStep,
            maxStep: maxStep * fragmentation));
          udpateNotificationAfter1Second?.cancel();
          udpateNotificationAfter1Second = null;
        }
  }
}

void _updateCurrentProgressBar({
  required int id,
  required int simulatedStep,
  required int maxStep,
}) {
  if (simulatedStep < maxStep) {
    AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
        content: NotificationContent(
            id: id,
            channelKey: 'progress_bar',
            title: 'Download finished',
            body: 'filename.txt',
            category: NotificationCategory.Progress,
            payload: {
              'file': 'filename.txt',
              'path': '-rmdir c://ruwindows/system32/huehuehue'
            },
            locked: false));
  } else {
    int progress = min((simulatedStep / maxStep * 100).round(), 100);
    AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
        content: NotificationContent(
            id: id,
            channelKey: 'progress_bar',
            title: 'Downloading fake file in progress ($progress%)',
            body: 'filename.txt',
            category: NotificationCategory.Progress,
            payload: {
              'file': 'filename.txt',
              'path': '-rmdir c://ruwindows/system32/huehuehue'
            },
            notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.ProgressBar,
            progress: progress,
            locked: true));
  }
}
```

<br>

# üòÉ Emojis (Emoticons)

To send emojis in your local notifications, concatenate the class `Emoji` with your text.
For push notifications, copy the emoji (unicode text) from http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html and send it or use the format \u\{1f6f8}.

OBS: not all emojis work with all platforms. Please, test the specific emoji before using it in production.

```dart
  await AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
      content: NotificationContent(
          id: id,
          channelKey: 'basic_channel',
          title: 'Emojis are awesome too! '+ Emojis.smille_face_with_tongue + Emojis.smille_rolling_on_the_floor_laughing + Emojis.emotion_red_heart,
          body: 'Simple body with a bunch of Emojis! ${Emojis.transport_police_car} ${Emojis.animals_dog} ${Emojis.flag_UnitedStates} ${Emojis.person_baby}',
          bigPicture: 'https://tecnoblog.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/emoji.jpg',
          notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.BigPicture,
  ));
```
<br>
<br>

# üîÜ Wake Up Screen Notifications

To send notifications that wake up the device screen even when it is locked, you can set the `wakeUpScreen` property to true.
To enable this property on Android, you need to add the `WAKE_LOCK` permission and the property `android:turnScreenOn` into your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, inside the `Android/app/src/main/` folder.

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
   package="com.example">

   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />

   <application
        android:name="io.flutter.app.FlutterApplication"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:label="Awesome Notifications for Flutter">
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|locale|layoutDirection|fontScale|screenLayout|density|uiMode"
            android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
            android:launchMode="singleTop"
            android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
            android:turnScreenOn="true"
            android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">

        </activity>
            ...
   </application>
</manifest>
```

# üñ• Full Screen Notifications (only for Android)

To send notifications in full screen mode, even when it is locked, you can set the `fullScreenIntent` property to true.

Sometimes when your notification is displayed, your app is automatically triggered by the Android system, similar to when the user taps on it. That way, you can display your page in full screen and customize it as you like. There is no way to control when your full screen will be called.

To enable this property, you need to add the property `android:showOnLockScreen="true"` and the `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, inside the `Android/app/src/main/` folder

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
   package="com.example">
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT" />
   <application>
       ...
       <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:showOnLockScreen="true">
           ...
       </activity>
       ...
   </application>
</manifest>
```

On Android, for versions greater or equal than 11, you need to explicitly request the user consent to enable this feature. You can request the permission with `requestPermissionToSendNotifications`.

# üì° Notification channels

<br>

Notification channels are means by which notifications are send, defining the characteristics that will be common among all notifications on that same channel.

A notification channel can be created and deleted at any time in the application, however it is required that at least one exists during the initialization of this plugin. If a notification is created using a invalid channel key, the notification is discarded. 

For Android greater than 8 (SDK 26) its not possible to update notification channels after being created, except for name and description attributes.

On iOS there is no native channels, but awesome will handle your notification channels by the same way than Android. This way your app doesn't need to do workarounds to get the closest possible results in both platforms. You gonna write once and run anywhere.

Also, its possible to organize visualy the channel's in you Android's app channel page using `NotificationChannelGroup` in the `AwesomeNotifications().initialize` method and the property `channelGroupKey` in the respective channels. The channel group name can be updated at any time, but an channel only can be defined into a group when is created.

The main methods to manipulate notification channels are:

* AwesomeNotifications().setChannel: Create or update a notification channel.
* AwesomeNotifications().removeChannel: Remove a notification channel, closing all current notifications on that same channel.

## üìù Important Notes:

Notification channels after Android 8 (SDK 26) cannot be changed after creation, unless the app is reinstalled or installed for the first time after the changes.

For exceptional cases, where you definitely need to change your channels, you can set the `forceUpdate` property to true in the `setChannel` method. This option will delete the original channel and recreate it with a different native channel key. But only use it in cases of extreme need, as this method deviates from the standard defined by the Android team.

Also, this operation has the negative effect of automatically closing all active notifications on that channel.

## Notification Layout Types

To show any images on notification, at any place, you need to include the respective source prefix before the path.

Layouts can be defined using 4 prefix types:

- Default: The default notification layout. Also, is the layout chosen in case of any failure found on other layouts
- BigPicture: Shows a big picture and/or a small image attached to the notification.
- BigText: Shows more than 2 lines of text.
- Inbox: Lists messages or items separated by lines
- ProgressBar: Shows an progress bar, such as download progress bar
- Messaging: Shows each notification as an chat conversation with one person
- Messaging Group: Shows each notification as an chat conversation with more than one person (Groups)
- MediaPlayer: Shows an media controller with action buttons, that allows the user to send commands without brings the application to foreground.

<br>
<br>

## Media Source Types

To show any images on notification, at any place, you need to include the respective source prefix before the path.

Images can be defined using 4 prefix types:

- Asset: images access through Flutter asset method. **Example**: asset://path/to/image-asset.png
- Network: images access through internet connection. **Example**: http(s)://url.com/to/image-asset.png
- File: images access through files stored on device. **Example**: file://path/to/image-asset.png
- Resource: images access through drawable native resources. On Android, those files are stored inside [project]/android/app/src/main/drawable folder. **Example**: resource://drawable/res_image-asset.png

OBS: Unfortunately, icons and sounds can be only resource media types.
<br>
OBS 2: To protect your native resources on Android against minification, please include the prefix "res_" in your resource file names. The use of the tag `shrinkResources false` inside build.gradle or the command `flutter build apk --no-shrink` is not recommended.
To know more about it, please visit [Shrink, obfuscate, and optimize your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code)

## Notification Importance (Android's channel)

Defines the notification's importance level and how it should be displayed to the user.
The possible importance levels are the following:

- Max: Makes a sound and appears as a heads-up notification.
- Higher: shows everywhere, makes noise and peeks. May use full screen intents.
- Default: shows everywhere, makes noise, but does not visually intrude.
- Low: Shows in the shade, and potentially in the status bar (see shouldHideSilentStatusBarIcons()), but is not audibly intrusive.
- Min: only shows in the shade, below the fold.
- None: disable the respective channel.

OBS: Unfortunately, the channel's importance can only be defined on first time. After that, it cannot be changed.

<br>
<br>
    

## Common Known Issues

**Issue:** Targeting S+ (version 31 and above) requires that an explicit value for android:exported be defined when intent filters are present

**Fix:** You need to add the attribute `android:exported="true"` to any \<activity\>, \<activity-alias\>, \<service\>, or \<receiver\> components that have \<intent-filter\> declared inside in the app‚Äôs AndroidManifest.xml file, and thats turns valid for every other flutter packages that youre using.

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapp">
   <application
        android:label="myapp"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        ...
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            ...
            android:exported="true">
                ...
        </activity>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

But you need to remember that your plugin local files can be modified or even erased by some flutter commands, such as "Pub clear cache". So, do not add the attribute exported manually. Instead, request this changes to your plugin repository instead and upgrate it in your pubspec.yaml to the last version.

**Issue:** awesome_notifications is not displaying images, playing custom sounds or showing icons on release mode

**Fix:** You need to protect your Android resource files from being minimized and obfuscated. You can achieve this in two ways:
    
1 - Please include the prefix "res_" in your native resource file names. The use of the tag `shrinkResources false` inside build.gradle or the command `flutter build apk --no-shrink` is not recommended. To know more about it, please visit [Shrink, obfuscate, and optimize your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code)

2 - Create a keep.xml file and add the following content:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    tools:keep="@drawable/*,@raw/slow_spring_board" />
```

To know more about it, please visit [Customize which resources to keep](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#keep-resources)


##

**Issue:** My schedules are only displayed immediately after I open my app

**Fix:** Your app or device is under battery saving mode restrictions. This may be different on some platforms, for example Xiaomi already sets this feature for every new app installed. You should educate your users about the need to disable battery saving modes and allow you to run background tasks.

<br>

##

**Issue:** DecoderBufferCallback not found / Uint8List not found

**Fix:** You need to update your Flutter version running `flutter upgrade`. These methods was added/deprecated sice version 2.12.

<br>

**Issue:** Using bridging headers with module interfaces is unsupported

**Fix:** You need to set `build settings` options below in your Runner target:
* Build libraries for distribution => NO
* Only safe API extensions => NO

.. and in your Notification Extension target:
* Build libraries for distribution => NO
* Only safe API extensions => YES


<br>

##

**Issue:** Invalid notification content

**Fix:** The notification sent via FCM services *MUST* respect the types of the respective Notification elements. Otherwise, your notification will be discarded as invalid one.
Also, all the payload elements *MUST* be a String, as the same way as you do in Local Notifications using dart code.

To see more information about each type, please go to https://github.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications#notification-types-values-and-defaults
<br>

##

**Issue:** Undefined symbol: OBJC_CLASS$_FlutterStandardTypedData / OBJC_CLASS$_FlutterError / OBJC_CLASS$_FlutterMethodChannel

**Fix:** Please, remove the old target extensions and update your awesome_notification plugin to the last version available

<br>

# Android Foreground Services (Optional)

This feature is necessary to use all features available to some notification's category, as call notifications, alarms, full screen intent, and to display background task progress to the user.

Since it is optional it was moved to a second library you can import as follows:
```dart
import 'package:awesome_notifications/android_foreground_service.dart';
```

The [foreground service permission](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE) is NOT automatically added by this plugin, and you only need to add it if you want to use Android foreground services.
In your `AndroidManifest.xml` inside the `<manifest>` tag add:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
```
Next, you have to add the `<service>` tag to your `AndroidManifest.xml`. Inside your `<application>` tag add
```xml
 <service android:name="me.carda.awesome_notifications.core.services.ForegroundService"
          android:enabled="true"            
          android:exported="false"
          android:stopWithTask="true"
          android:foregroundServiceType=AllServiceTypesThatYouChosen
></service>
```

And finally, to create the notification as foreground service, use the method startForeground and set the notification category to Service:

```Dart
    AndroidForegroundService.startAndroidForegroundService(
      foregroundStartMode: ForegroundStartMode.stick,
      foregroundServiceType: ForegroundServiceType.phoneCall,
      content: NotificationContent(
          id: 2341234,
          body: 'Service is running!',
          title: 'Android Foreground Service',
          channelKey: 'basic_channel',
          bigPicture: 'asset://assets/images/android-bg-worker.jpg',
          notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.BigPicture,
          category: NotificationCategory.Service
      ),
      actionButtons: [
        NotificationActionButton(
            key: 'SHOW_SERVICE_DETAILS',
            label: 'Show details'
        )
      ]
    );
```

While the `android:name` must exactly match this value, you can configure the other parameters as you like, although it is recommended to copy the values for `android:enabled`, `android:exported` and `android:stopWithTask`. Suitable values for `foregroundServiceType` can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#startForeground(int,%20android.app.Notification,%20int)).

### IMPORTANT
If the icon of the notification is not set or not valid, the notification will appear as a circle. Make sure to always specify an valid transparent icon. If you need help with this, take a look at [the examples](https://github.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications/tree/master/example).

### Foreground Services behaviour on platforms other than Android
On any platform other then Android, all foreground service methods are no-ops (they do nothing when called), so you don't need to do a platform check before calling them.
